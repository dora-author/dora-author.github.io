## 내용 요약  
지난 주 다루었던 [`Technical Report Writing for Engineers - Summary`](https://dora-author.github.io/technical-report-writing-week1/) 전체 챕터 중 __Intoduction section__ 에 관하여 설명한다.  
 Intoduction section에서 포함되어야 할 내용 및 세부 작성법, 규칙 등에 관하여 중요하다 싶은 부분은

## The Introduction section

<span style="color:red">The Introduction provides the reader with the background to the work documented in the report.</span>  

 In your Introduction, you should:  

  - <span style="color:red">Provide background information on the subject.  
  - <span style="color:red">Reference work that has already been conducted on the same subject.  
  - <span style="color:red">Write aims and objectives for your work.  
  - <span style="color:red">Communicate the reasons why the work is being conducted.  
  </span>

## Setting the scene

The Introduction gives your reader the necessary context for reading and understanding the rest of the material in your report.   
It should introduce the problem that you are trying to learn more about and the key application points for your work.  

As this is a technical report, it is important to place your work into the context of the science surrounding it. 

Your Introduction should contain:

 - A review of the background literature - <span style="color:red">the relevant theory and methods should be included here (with references to back them up) in order to show a good scientific background to the work</span>.

 - An appreciation of the wider engineering context - <span style="color:red">what are the important theories or properties being tested and how are they utilised in real engineering situations</span>?

 - The specific problem that you are investigating - broken down into <span style="color:red">the aim and objectives of the experiments</span>.

A good way to start is to bullet point what you need to include or know already, then check that you are covering all the aspects of that section.

This can be done by considering some simple questions.

1. Is the problem clearly defined?
2. Have you explained why the problem is interesting?
3. Are the foundations of the work explained? What have other people done in this area?
