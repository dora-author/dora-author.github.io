## 내용 요약  
엔지니어, 개발자들이 작성하는 기술 보고서 작성법에 관한 내용이다.  
[1주차 내용]에서는 제목을 포함한 기술 보고서의 목차를 다루며,
각 목차 별 주제와 포함되어야 하는 필수 요소들을 요약한다.  
세부 내용에서 중요점을 정리하여 번역하고 싶었지만 시간 관계상

## what exactly is a technical report?

A **technical report** is one of the principal methods of communication used by practising engineers.

## The anatomy of a technical report

### __Title__
The title provides a name for the report.  
It should be a few words that <span style="color:red">describe the content of the document, which would typically involve the aim of what is trying to be achieved.</span> <br/><br/>

### 1. Abstract  
An abstract, sometimes called <span style="color:red">a summary or an executive summary, is the first section to appear after the title,</span> and is a succinct review of all the important information included in the report. The purpose of an abstract is for a reader to determine if they would like to read the report in more detail or to move on if it isn’t exactly what they’re looking for. <br/>

### 2. Introduction ⭐
An introduction is <span style="color:red">a review of the background and context of the work</span> that is presented in the report, <span style="color:red">setting the reader up to understand why you have chosen to do the work</span> you are discussing. It might include how the work fits into the wider world, how it adds to the current understanding of the field of study, and <span style="color:red">what you hope to achieve as aims and objectives</span>.<br/>

### 3. Theory
If required, a technical report may contain a theory section, which <span style="color:red">provides a reader with the necessary technical background</span> to appreciate the work that is presented in the report. If it’s critical that the reader understands <span style="color:red">a particular concept</span> in order to understand your work, then a theory section is the place to describe it.

### 4. Procedure ⭐
The procedure section describes <span style="color:red">the methods or equipment used to achieve the outcomes of the work</span>. It is written as a chronological record of the steps that were performed to achieve the results, with <span style="color:red">enough detail to allow the reader to repeat what was done</span>.

### 5. Result ⭐
The results section presents <span style="color:red">an impartial record of the outcomes of the work, describing what the results are and what facts or understanding can clearly be extracted from them</span>. Data should be processed to convey the main findings of the work rather than the details of every result.

### 6. Discussion ⭐
The discussion is perhaps the most important section of a technical engineering report.  
It is <span style="color:red">the opportunity for the writer to analyse results, express their opinions of the work, and provide an interpretation of the significance of the outcomes</span>. It may include conjecture as to why trends in the results have occurred and limitations of the process that has been employed.  
A discussion can also include a description of the impact of the work and how it will make a change to the world, even if only in a small way. 

### 7. Conclusion 
A conclusion is a short review of the results that have been deduced and the impact of the work. <span style="color:red">It answers questions posed in the introduction and states if aims and objectives have been met</span>.  
Readers will quite often skip to the conclusion section of a report to quickly determine what you found out and what it means to them.

### 8. Further Work
A further work section is sometimes included when the writer wants to suggest things that haven’t been included in the report that can be done to advance the project. 

### 9. References ⭐
References are <span style="color:red">detailed lists of external resources that have been indicated and cited in the main body of the report that readers may want to track down</span>.

### 10. Appendices
Supplementary information that may be of interest to the reader is stored in appendices. These include any material that is worth the reader having access to, but <span style="color:red">not directly relevant to the main points raised in the report</span>.

### Have you mastered this structure?

Go at structuring a report for yourself in [drag and drop game](https://mooc-assets.shef.ac.uk/technical_reports/interactive_exercise/drag_and_drop/main.html). 

You’ll be asked to put the title sections in order and then match them to the correct description. This works best on a laptop or desktop and may not work on mobiles and tablets.
